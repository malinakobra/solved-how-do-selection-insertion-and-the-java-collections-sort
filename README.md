<br>
1. How do selection, insertion, and the Java Collections sort differ in the time required to sort data ranging from 10,000 elements to 250,000 elements (in increments of 10,000 elements) of random data extracted from the digits of the square root of two?

2. How do linear and binary search compare with one another in terms of the time for find each of the elements in the array as the number of elements range from 10,000 to 250,000 in increments of 10,000?

3.Analyze the data and describe what it tells you about the algorithms and their ability to “scale up”

5.Use the data to predict the execution time if he data set contained 1,000,000 elements.

(Do not guess.

Use your data and justify your prediction.)
